                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the tomatoes, season well and fry for 4-5 mins, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften and caramelise. Stir in the garlic, chillies and lemon zest, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2-3 mins until fragrant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti to pack instructions. Drain, reserving 2 tbsp of the cooking water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stir the pesto, lemon juice and reserved cooking water into the pasta, using tongs to toss everything together to coat. Toss through half the tomatoes, then divide between 4 bowls and spoon over the remaining tomatoes. Sprinkle with extra chillies to serve, if you like.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stir through a large handful of spinach per person to help towards your 5-a-day.
                    </li>
                </ol>
